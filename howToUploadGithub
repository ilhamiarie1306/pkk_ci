1. Log into github.com and in the top right click on user name and select Settings
2. Scroll down and click on Developer Settings on the left sidebar menu
3. On the left sidebar click on Personal Access Tokens
4. Click on Generate New Access Token
5. I made a note to know it was for netbeans
6. Set the expiration you want, and make sure to grant access to all the repo items
7. It will generate a token. Copy this token and be aware that you can't access this again but you can regenerate a new one.
Back in Netbeans when trying to access git remote use the token you just copied instead of the password.
